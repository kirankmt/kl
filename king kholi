The ‘Library Management system’ undertaken as a project is based on relevant technologies, which is an attempt to automate the existing library. The project enables its user to perform all the operations regarding a library. The project enables the user to make entry of a new book, deleting the record of a book from the library, issuing a book to member, making entry of a new member, deleting the record of a member from the library etc.  The process model we have used for our project is Linear Sequential because the requirements are well stated and understood before in hand. In analysis phase we analysed the requirements of what the project will do. We collected the requirements needed to develop the project. Then in the design phase we designed our project according to user satisfaction. We created database to store the details of members, books in tables. We designed DFD diagrams based  upon the operations that was carrying in the project. Then cost and effort estimations are calculated and testing and coding processes have been carried out.
Hence in the existing system for LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, the performance evaluation system and the maintenance are done manually. The proposed system will maintain all the information in a standard database and will be able to generate reports when necessary.

Abstract
The management and booking of Rooms in hotels is a tedious and complicated task especially if it is done manually. Keeping track of large customers and all their details requires an inordinate space for file cabinets, not to mention the time the hotel administrator would spend going back and forth to file cabinets so as to look up each customer’s information. This is why a good hotel reservation system is needed to make this task as easy as possible. This paper shows how the noted complicated human task can be solved by using a database Management System together with scripting and programming languages like Html and PHP respectively as the key tools in the development of a hotel reservation System. The system was developed using the object-oriented software development approach which includes the use of object-oriented analysis, object- oriented design and object-oriented programming. This was done so that the developed software can be maintainable, reliable and scalable.
Introduction
The advances in mobile technology and availability of broadband have made it easier to search for a hotel and book through an online reservation system [1]. Although mobile applications are unlikely to revolutionize a hotels’ reservation system to the same extent that the internet did, it may have an impact on hotel revenue management and the concept of implementing price structures. An effective reservation system has to employ the latest technology to allow hoteliers to gain a competitive advantage over their rivals and remain at the forefront of emerging trends.

Write the test suite for the above requirement
1.	Verify that there is a portal to add new flights in the system.
2.	Verify that on filling flight details like flight name, code, from and to destinations, capacity, timings, and frequency etc, new filghts get successfully added in the system.
3.	Verify that users can search for flights by name, from-to airports or flight code for checking their status and timings.
4.	Verify that search results have flight details, timings and availability.
5.	Verify that clicking the search results open complete details for flight.
Introduction
•	Hospital Management System follows INCREMENTAL MODEL because initially software requirements are reasonably well defined but the overall scope of development effort is a purely linear process. 
•	There may be other requirements of the user which will be known later. 
•	So, those requirements can the implemented and delivered in the following next increments.

• The system automates the manual procedure of managing hospital activities. 
• Doctors can view their patients’ treatment records and details easily. 
• It even generates an instant bill.
 • The system is convenient and flexible to be used. 
• It saves their time, efforts, money and resources.

 • Requires large database. 
• The admin has to manually keep updating the information by entering the details in the system. 
• Need Internet connection
Hardware Requirement
